    <h2>
      What difference should you expect if coming from High School?
    </h2>

    <p>
      Your <strong>student role</strong> has many differences between high
      school and university, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>You are responsible for your own learning</strong></li>
      <li>No one will remind you to attend classes or do your schoolwork.</li>
      <li>
        You may find yourself spending more time studying than attending
        lectures.
      </li>
      <li>
        Professors (and possibly teaching assistants) have weekly office hours.
        This can be helpful if you have questions and need further
        clarification. However you will not see them as often as you likely saw
        your high school teachers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Many campus services will be available for you if you require assistance
        with learning tips for success and staying motivated. Stay tuned for
        emails from your faculty as well.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Your schedule will look quite different</strong></li>
      <li>
        Depending on your program, you may have 15 hours of class a week and get
        to pick your course schedule.
      </li>
      <li>Classes can vary between 1.5 and 3 hours.</li>
      <li>There will be gaps between classes.</li>
      <li>
        You may have to travel to a different building to get to your next
        class.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong
          >You will know the course schedules and generally what to expect at
          the start of the course</strong
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        On the first day of class, you will get a course schedule and know all
        your assignments, readings and test dates for most of the term. Your
        faculty will announce final exam dates later.
      </li>
      <li>
        A term runs for about 3 1/2 months, so it is common to have 3 or 4
        assessments in a term. Assignments or quizzes may also appear.
      </li>
    </ul>
