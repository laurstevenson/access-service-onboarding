<h2>
  What difference should you expect if coming from High School?
</h2>

<p>
  Your <strong>student role</strong> has many differences between high school and university, such as:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>You are responsible for your own learning</strong></li>
    <li>No one will remind you to attend classes or do your schoolwork.</li>
    <li>You may find yourself spending more time studying than attending lectures.</li>
    <li>Professors (and possibly teaching assistants) have weekly office hours. This can be helpful if you have questions and need further clarification. However you will not see them as often as you likely saw your high school teachers.</li>
    <li>Many campus services will be available for you if you require assistance with learning tips for success and staying motivated. Stay tuned for emails from your faculty as well.       </li>
  </ul>
<br>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Your schedule will look quite different</strong></li>  
    <li>Depending on your program, you may have 15 hours of class a week and get to pick your course schedule.</li>
    <li>Classes can vary between 1.5 and 3 hours.</li>
    <li>There will be gaps between classes.</li>
    <li>You may have to travel to a different building to get to your next class.</li>
  </ul>
<br>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>You will know the course schedules and generally what to expect at the start of the course</strong></li>
    <li>On the first day of class, you will get a course schedule and know all your assignments, readings and test dates for most of the term. Your faculty will announce final exam dates later.</li>
    <li>A term runs for about 3 1/2 months, so it is common to have 3 or 4 assessments in a term. Assignments or quizzes may also appear.</li>
  </ul>
