      Academic Accommodations

    <h2>
      Goal of the Accommodation Process
    </h2>
    
    <p>
      To put students on an equal playing field. The student should still feel challenged with their studies but not to the point where things are impossible to access.

The academic accommodation plan put in place at the University of Ottawa may be different from the one in high school or another institution.  We support studentsâ€™ needs in the academic setting while respecting the essential course requirements. The course curriculum stays the same.
