        Introducting the types of Accommodations at the University of Ottawa
      </h3>

      <div class="info-box">
        We offer a wide variety of adapted exams, services, strategies,
        equipment and process that level the playing field for students with
        disabilities. The types of academic accommodations that can be part of
        an Academic Accommodation Plan include:<br />
        <ul class="accom-plan">
          <li>Teaching accommodations</li>
          <li>Transcription services</li>
          <li>Interpretation services</li>
          <li>Library accessibility</li>

        <h3>
          Your Academic Accommodation Plan at the University of Ottawa
        </h3>
        <p>
          Once you and your Learning Specialist establish your individualized
          accommodation plan an automatic email will be sent to notify the
          professor of each course.<br />
          <br />
          The email states your name, student number and the supports you may
          request for their course. This information is shared since they are
          partners with you and us in the accommodations process.<br />
          <br />
          Professors do not see any diagnosis, meeting notes, or documentation
          that you have provided your Learning Specialist by upload to Ventus.
        </p>

      <h3>
        Teaching and Classroom Accommodations
      </h3>

      <div class="info-box">
        <p>
          These accommodations are in place to help students during the
          classroom, labs or on-line setting for their courses.<br />
          <br />
          Examples of this type of accommodation can include things such as
          extra note taking support, interpretation, accessible classroom for
          mobility, professor’s approval for equipment and more.<br />
        </p>

        <p></p>
        <h4>
          Teaching Accommodations: Per course accommodations
        </h4>
        <p>
          A ‘per course’ accommodations plan means that it can be modified to
          suit your needs and challenges in a specific course. You select the
          accommodations at the start of the semester.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          Each course can include unique expectations such as lectures, labs,
          assignments, participation marks, presentations, group work or
          examinations. Sometimes, certain courses are more or less challenging
          than others depending on your strengths and weaknesses. By selecting a
          per course accommodation plan, this allows you to have more specific
          accommodations for each course you are enrolled in to include only the
          accommodations you need in that course situation.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Classroom services and access to information
        </h4>
        <p>
          Service provision plans provide bilingual interpretation and note
          taking services required by deaf and hard of hearing students. They
          include sign language interpreters and note takers who will accompany
          you to class and sign in real-time or transcribe your lectures word
          for word. Students who are blind or have visual impairment or have
          limited mobility may require similar services. If their program
          involves lab work or research, these students may also request the
          services of a lab assistant or assistance to select books and tools
          for research in the library. The Learning Specialist must first
          approve these services.
        </p>

      <h3>
        Transcription Accommodations
      </h3>

      <div class="info-box">
        <p>
          These accommodations are for print disabilities when students require
          electronic format or alternative format in order to read.<br />
          <br />
          Examples of transcription formats large print and even braille in
          order to read text.<br />
          <br />
          Students are responsible to place requests for alternative formats of
          text as soon as the course readings list and textbook information
          becomes available. Readings and textbook information is usually found
          in the course syllabus (course information document) provided by the
          professor at the beginning of each semester.<br />

      <h3>
        Library Accessibility
      </h3>

      <div class="info-box">
        <p>
          The Library offers a range of services from research support for
          assignments to study spaces. The Library also provides accessible
          versions of library books to students who have print disabilities
          (when approved by a Learning Specialist). If you would like to request
          access, e-mail libadapt@uottawa.ca and they will be pleased to help
          you. You can also access various adaptive technology software
          remotely. For more information about all of the library services,
          visit: https://biblio.uottawa.ca/en/services/accessibility

      <h3>
        Learning Strategies and Technologies
      </h3>

      <div class="info-box">
        <h4>
          Learning Strategies 'toolbox'
        </h4>
        <p>
          Learning strategies are a very important component of the Academic
          Accommodations sector. If you have never heard of learning strategies
          before, imagine they are the toolbox, which will help you thrive in
          your academic journey. Some examples of the Learning strategies in
          your toolbox could include reading strategies, time management
          strategies or note taking tools.
        </p>

        <h4>
          Assistive technologies
        </h4>
        <p>
          This toolbox may include assistive technologies, which will help you
          read, take notes, and write essays. Among these tools, you will find
          programs that read a document aloud, some which allow you to highlight
          text and summarize notes, and devices which record a lecture while you
          write your notes. If you have never used such devices or if you want
          to explore different types of technology, we offer meetings with your
          Learning specialist or a training session in the Assistive Technology
          Lab. We will explore different options with you and train you on the
          ones which best suit your learning needs. If you find note taking
          daunting, for example, we can also teach you methods to improve your
          note taking skills. You can discuss training opportunities with your
          Learning Specialist during an appointment.
        </p>

        <h4>
          Adapt your toolbox and accommodations along the way...
        </h4>
        <p>
          Regardless of the type of disability, if you find yourself struggling
          with difficult subjects as the term progresses, you can discuss your
          need for services with your Learning Specialist. These services do not
          need to be arranged during your initial appointment with your Learning
          Specialist. They can be added to your file during the term as your
          experience evolves. The toolbox can also be tailored to specific
          courses. For example, you may not need a note-taking support for every
          course in your course load. Your skills and needs might change over
          the years and so can your learning strategies and accommodations.<br />
          <br />
          It is important you have the right tools to learn and to succeed
          alongside your colleagues. Please do not hesitate to express your
          needs to your Learning Specialist.

      <h3>
        Exam accommodations
      </h3>

      <div class="info-box">
        <p>
          Regulation I-9 guides the evaluation of student learning to assess
          student progress in a course using different assessment methods, such
          as assignments, projects and examinations. Exam Accommodations may be
          offered to modify the format of an evaluation for some students with
          disabilities.<br />
          <br />
          These accommodations are established to support students in our Exams
          Centre for quizzes, tests, midterms, and finals.<br />
          <br />
          Students with accommodations always have the option to choose if they
          will write their exams with their accommodations.<br />
          <br />
          Examples of exam supports include things like extra time for exams, a
          low distraction space to write, or access to assistive technology.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h4>
          You mut confirm every exam accommodation
        </h4>
        <p>
          If you are eligible for any examination accommodations, the professor
          is asked to submit a Notice of examination to the Ventus system to
          notify our office and you of the exam details. You will need to
          confirm in Ventus if you want to apply some or all of your
          accommodations to that exam date/time.<br />
          <br />

          Students receive automatic email messages when a Notice of examination
          is entered in the student portal. ​It is the student's responsibility
          to confirm in the Ventus student portal if they will write an exam
          with academic accommodations. This is not automatic. You must confirm
          in Ventus every exam at least 7 days before the date of the
          examination or by November 15/March 15 for final exam periods in
          Fall/Winter. ​Otherwise, without confirmation, we all assume you are
          choosing to write the test without academic support and in the
          classroom.<br />
          <br />

          For on-line examinations, your professors will often input extra time
          accommodations for exams. Please confirm your request by email to your
          professors to clarify your request for extra time accommodation.​

      <h3>
        Deferred Evaluations
      </h3>

      <div class="info-box">
        <p>
          <strong>About deferred examinations...</strong><br />
          Missed a University exam or an assignment? In some cases, due to a
          medical condition, an assignment due date or an exam cannot be met and
          in this case a doctor’s note is often required. Giving a later date
          for that exam or assignment is called a deferral.<br />
          <br />
          The decision on granting a deferred exam and/or a deferred mark is at
          the level of the professors, departments and/or faculties. The
          Academic Accommodations office cannot validate medical or medication
          issues and has no authority on the deferred exam process. Each Faculty
          has its own internal process to request a deferred exam or deferred
          mark.<br />
          <br />
          Students registered in the Academic Accommodations Sector must follow
          the same process as other students as established in Academic
          Regulation I-9 and II-5. We often refer to this as Academic regulation
          9.5. Here is more explanation on the regulations if you are
          interested:
          https://www.uottawa.ca/vice-president-academic/academic-regulations-explained/exams<br />
          <br />
          The deferred exam process for students registered with our service is
          as follows:
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="deferred-steps">
        <ol>
          <li>
            Student request a deferred exam to the appropriate authority
            according to their faculty’s process
          </li>
          <li>Faculty/Department or Professor grant a deferred exam</li>
          <li>
            Faculty/Department or Professor submits the Notice of Examination in
            Ventus.
          </li>
          <li>
            Students confirm in Ventus if they will be writing at the Academic
            Accommodations Exam Centre
          </li>
          <li>
            Exam Centre follows the regular exam accommodation process as they
            do for any other booked examination
          </li>
