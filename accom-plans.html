      Introducting the types of Accommodations at the University of Ottawa
    </h3>
    
    <p>
      We offer a wide variety of adapted exams, services, strategies, equipment and process that level the playing field for students with disabilities. The types of academic accommodations that can be part of an Academic Accommodation Plan include:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Teaching accommodations</li>
        <li>Transcription services</li>
        <li>Interpretation services</li>
        <li>Library accessibility</li>
        <li>Learning Strategies and technologies</li>
        <li>Exam accommodations</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
    <h4>
      Your Academic Accommodation Plan at the University of Ottawa
    </h4>
    Once you and your Learning Specialist establish your individualized accommodation plan an automatic email will be sent to notify the professor of each course.<br>
    <br>
    The email states your name, student number and the supports you may request for their course. This information is shared since they are partners with you and us in the accommodations process.<br>
    <br>
    Professors do not see any diagnosis, meeting notes, or documentation that you have provided your Learning Specialist by upload to Ventus.

  <h4>
    Teaching and Classroom Accommodations
  </h4>
  
  <p>
    These accommodations are in place to help students during the classroom, labs or on-line setting for their courses.<br>
<br>
Examples of this type of accommodation can include things such as extra note taking support, interpretation, accessible classroom for mobility, professor’s approval for equipment and more.<br>
    
    <h5>
      Teaching Accommodations: Per course accommodations
  </h5>
  A ‘per course’ accommodations plan means that it can be modified to suit your needs and challenges in a specific course. You select the accommodations at the start of the semester.

Each course can include unique expectations such as lectures, labs, assignments, participation marks, presentations, group work or examinations. Sometimes, certain courses are more or less challenging than others depending on your strengths and weaknesses. By selecting a per course accommodation plan, this allows you to have more specific accommodations for each course you are enrolled in to include only the accommodations you need in that course situation.
  <h5>
    Classroom services and access to information
  </h5>
  Service provision plans provide bilingual interpretation and note taking services required by deaf and hard of hearing students. They include sign language interpreters and note takers who will accompany you to class and sign in real-time or transcribe your lectures word for word. Students who are blind or have visual impairment or have limited mobility may require similar services. If their program involves lab work or research, these students may also request the services of a lab assistant or assistance to select books and tools for research in the library. The Learning Specialist must first approve these services.

<h4>
  Transcription Accommodations
</h4>
<p>
  These accommodations are for print disabilities when students require electronic format or alternative format in order to read.

Examples of transcription formats large print and even braille in order to read text.

Students are responsible to place requests for alternative formats of text as soon as the course readings list and textbook information becomes available. Readings and textbook information is usually found in the course syllabus (course information document) provided by the professor at the beginning of each semester.

<h4>
  Library Accessibility
</h4>
<p>
  The Library offers a range of services from research support for assignments to study spaces. The Library also provides accessible versions of library books to students who have print disabilities (when approved by a Learning Specialist). If you would like to request access, e-mail libadapt@uottawa.ca and they will be pleased to help you. You can also access various adaptive technology software remotely.

<h4>
  Learning Strategies and Technologies
</h4>
<p>
  <h5>
    Learning Strategies 'toolbox'
</h5>
Learning strategies are a very important component of the Academic Accommodations sector. If you have never heard of learning strategies before, imagine they are the toolbox, which will help you thrive in your academic journey. Some examples of the Learning strategies in your toolbox could include reading strategies, time management strategies or note taking tools.

<h5>
  Assistive technologies
</h5>
This toolbox may include assistive technologies, which will help you read, take notes, and write essays. Among these tools, you will find programs that read a document aloud, some which allow you to highlight text and summarize notes, and devices which record a lecture while you write your notes. If you have never used such devices or if you want to explore different types of technology, we offer meetings with your Learning specialist or a training session in the Assistive Technology Lab. We will explore different options with you and train you on the ones which best suit your learning needs. If you find note taking daunting, for example, we can also teach you methods to improve your note taking skills. You can discuss training opportunities with your Learning Specialist during an appointment.

<h5>
  Adapt your toolbox and accommodations along the way...
</h5>
Regardless of the type of disability, if you find yourself struggling with difficult subjects as the term progresses, you can discuss your need for services with your Learning Specialist. These services do not need to be arranged during your initial appointment with your Learning Specialist. They can be added to your file during the term as your experience evolves. The toolbox can also be tailored to specific courses. For example, you may not need a note-taking support for every course in your course load. Your skills and needs might change over the years and so can your learning strategies and accommodations.

It is important you have the right tools to learn and to succeed alongside your colleagues. Please do not hesitate to express your needs to your Learning Specialist.

<h4>
  Exam accommodations
</h4>
<p>
  Academic regulation I-9 - Evaluation of student learning

Regulation I-9 guides the evaluation of student learning to assess student progress in a course using different assessment methods, such as assignments, projects and examinations. Exam Accommodations may be offered to modify the format of an evaluation for some students with disabilities.

These accommodations are established to support students in our Exams Centre for quizzes, tests, midterms, and finals.

Students with accommodations always have the option to choose if they will write their exams with their accommodations.

Examples of exam supports include things like extra time for exams, a low distraction space to write, or access to assistive technology.
  
  <h5>
    You mut confirm every exam accommodation
</h5>
If you are eligible for any examination accommodations, the professor is asked to submit a Notice of examination to the Ventus system to notify our office and you of the exam details. You will need to confirm in Ventus if you want to apply some or all of your accommodations to that exam date/time.


Students receive automatic email messages when a Notice of examination is entered in the student portal. ​It is the student's responsibility to confirm in the Ventus student portal if they will write an exam with academic accommodations. This is not automatic. You must confirm in Ventus every exam at least 7 days before the date of the examination or by November 15/March 15 for final exam periods in Fall/Winter. ​Otherwise, without confirmation, we all assume you are choosing to write the test without academic support and in the classroom. ​


For on-line examinations, your professors will often input extra time accommodations for exams. Please confirm your request by email to your professors to clarify your request for extra time accommodation.​

<h4>
  Deferred Evaluations
</h4>
<p>
  <strong>About deferred examinations...</strong><br>
  Missed a University exam or an assignment? In some cases, due to a medical condition, an assignment due date or an exam cannot be met and in this case a doctor’s note is often required. Giving a later date for that exam or assignment is called a deferral.

The decision on granting a deferred exam and/or a deferred mark is at the level of the professors, departments and/or faculties. The Academic Accommodations office cannot validate medical or medication issues and has no authority on the deferred exam process. Each Faculty has its own internal process to request a deferred exam or deferred mark.

Students registered in the Academic Accommodations Sector must follow the same process as other students as established in Academic Regulation I-9 and II-5. We often refer to this as Academic regulation 9.5. Here is more explanation on the regulations if you are interested: https://www.uottawa.ca/vice-president-academic/academic-regulations-explained/exams

The deferred exam process for students registered with our service is as follows:<br>
  <ol>
    <li>Student request a deferred exam to the appropriate authority according to their faculty’s process</li>
    <li>Faculty/Department or Professor grant a deferred exam</li>
    <li>Faculty/Department or Professor submits the Notice of Examination in Ventus.</li>
    <li>Students confirm in Ventus if they will be writing at the Academic Accommodations Exam Centre</li>
    <li>Exam Centre follows the regular exam accommodation process as they do for any other booked examination</li>
  </ol>
