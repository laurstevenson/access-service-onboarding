      What is a disability?
    </h2>
    
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Defining disability is a complex, evolving matter. The term “disability” covers a broad range and degree of conditions, which create impairments, activity limitations and participation restrictions.</li>

        <li>A disability may have been present at birth, caused by an accident, or developed over time. Disability is the interaction between a health condition (e.g. cerebral palsy, or depression) and personal and environmental factors (e.g. inaccessible public buildings or teaching formats).</li> 

        <li>“Disability can be situational in nature, dependent on environmental factors and circumstances.” (NEAD, 2018)</li>

        <li>Therefore, a person with a disability does not automatically mean that they are disabled.</li>
    </ul>
