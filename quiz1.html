      Certain disabilities are permanent, meaning that they are expected to remain with the person for life, while other disabilities are temporary and are expected to resolve or improve over time. Permanent conditions can be categorized as chronic, degenerative and/or episodic. Disabilities can be visible or invisible to others.
