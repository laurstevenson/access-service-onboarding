      <h4>
        What is Ventus?
    </h4>
    You may have heard that our University uses a tool called Ventus. What is it?<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Ventus is the Accommodation Management application designed to decrease the work required of students with disabilities, to streamline, simplify and speed up communication regarding student accommodations.</li>
      <li>It is used to facilitate information sharing between all of the partners in the accommodation process.           </li>
      <li>Ventus is an online portal used by students, learning specialists, professors and faculty to facilitate the adapted examination and accommodation process.</li>
      </ul>
    The Ventus student portal lets you create your own account, which guarantees that all of your personal information is kept confidential. Ventus will allow you to:
      <ul>
        <li>submit medical documentation</li>
        <li>keep track of all your present and past accommodations</li>
        <li>see your appointments dates and times</li>
        <li>see your exams throughout the semester</li>
        <li>confirm exam participation & select exam accommodations</li>
        <li>get reminders of when your medical documents or accommodations expire</li>
        <li>keep track of the letters issued by your learning specialist.</li>
        <li>access to the transcriptions request form if you need to have textbooks and readings transcribed into an alternate format</li>
        <li>access your profile on the go using either a smartphone or tablet</li>
      </ul>
    <h5>
      Where can I find Ventus?
    </h5>
    Ventus is found in several places on the uOttawa website:<br>
    1) Through the uOzone application: Login to your uOzone account and you will find Ventus in the "Applications" tab.<br>or<br>
    2)Directly on the Ventus website, a quick Google search for "Ventus uOttawa" will bring you there.<br>
    Please note: you will have to login using your uOttawa username and password.
    
    <h5>
      Who has access to Ventus?  
    </h5>
    All documentation added to Ventus is confidential. Only Academic Accommodations staff have access to this information. After submitting the information, our reception is automatically notified and we will contact you to ensure you know the steps to follow!
    
    Your professor and faculty members also have a Ventus Portal but with different access to information. This is where they find out which students registered in their courses also registered for Academic Accommodations. Therefore, faculty will have access to your name and accommodations only. 
    </p>
  
  <h4>
    Complete the Intake form
  </h4>

  <p>
    <h5>
      What is the intake form?
    </h5>
  
  The intake form is a short questionnaire about previous accommodations, your habits, abilities, and strengths, and the tools you already used to be successful in school.  After creating an account, you will be asked to fill out the intake form just one time. It lets the Learning Specialist know a little more about your learning skills, in-class and out-of-class before you meet to work together on identifying what your needs and accommodations.

Your answers will give your learning specialist insight about your challenges and supports for your academic journey.
  
  <h5>
    Where do I find the Intake form?
  </h5>
  
  The intake form is available when you first open your Ventus account.

Ensure that you have some time to spare to complete the questionnaire when you open your account. Once you hit submit, or if you skip this step, you will no longer be able to access the intake form. 
  
  <h5>
    Do my answers influence my accommodation plan?
  </h5>
  
  The Learning Specialist will review the intake form prior to your meeting.

The intake form is a great way to help us better understand your academic challenges and current needs through your own eyes.

Therefore, all documents and forms are taken into consideration while building your accommodation plan with the learning specialist.

<h4>
  Enter disability related documentation
</h4>

<p>
  <h5>
    What kind of documentation do I need?
  </h5>
We must ask for a document, which shows proof of a disability in order to offer accommodations. Our service accepts the following types of documents:
<ul>
  <li>Medical Certificate</li>
  <li>Mental Health Medical Certificate</li>
  <li>Psycho-educational assessments</li>
  <li>Neuropsychological assessments</li>
  <li>Vision assessments</li>
  <li>Audiology assessments</li>
</ul>

<h5>
  What is considered proper documentation?
</h5>
Each disability requires a different type of document. The type of documentation and the qualified health professionals able to provide it depends on the nature of the disability. We know…It can get confusing!

Therefore, our website offers a detailed grid to help ensure you have documents signed by the properly recognized and qualified health professional.

<h5>
  Who can fill out medical documentation?
</h5>
Documentation must be filled out and signed by a licensed, certified, practicing health professional who is familiar with your disability and qualified to make the diagnosis.<br>
Please note that a Learning Disability diagnosis requires a full psychoeducational assessment (PEA) completed by a recognized and qualified psychologist. A recent assessment using adult standardized tests will be required. You are welcome to contact us with any documentation questions at adapt@uottawa.ca.

<h5>
  What information should my medical documentation include?
</h5>

Medical Documentation must include:
<ul>
  <li>My name and identifying information such as date of birth.</li>
  <li>My health professional’s name, registration number and contact information.</li>
  <li>Confirmation of medical diagnosis.</li>
  <li>If your condition is permanent. If not, the condition is temporary and we request the anticipated duration of the condition. Otherwise, your accommodation plan is offered for the current academic semester.</li>
  <li>A list of functional limitations or symptoms. This information is important for the Learning Specialist to determine what kinds of accommodations are helpful to support you in your academic studies.</li>
</ul>

<h5>
  What if I cannot get any documentation right now?
</h5>
We advise that you book an appointment with your health professional as soon as possible.

If you have older or expired documentation, such as medical note, IEP or PEA, this could help to start the process while you get additional documentation.

If my medical conditions or learning difficulties are undetermined:

If your health professional is still investigating your diagnosis, our office may consider supports and accommodations with a medical note from the health professional who is treating the situation.

If you do not have documentation or a confirmed diagnosis but you have a learning issue, please contact our service for further information. We can meet with you to discuss your options

<h5>
  How do I provide my documentation?
</h5>

When you have your document, you can upload it to Ventus in several ways. Here are a few options:
<ol>
  <li>Go on your Ventus Portal and open the tab called “Profile”. You will find a button “+ Add disability information”. You will be able to add the file directly on Ventus this way. </li>
  <li>Your doctor may fax the document(s) to the following number: 613-562-5159.</li>
  <li>Unfortunately, at this time, you cannot bring your documentation directly to our office. In person services are not available until further notice.</li>
</ol>

    How do I book an appointment?
</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Sending an email to adapt@uottawa.ca</li>
  <li>Call us at 613-878-0146</li>
  <li>In person in the Desmarais Building, room 3172</li>
</ul>

<h5>
  What should I expect during my initial appointment?
</h5>
Your initial appointment will last around 1h. During that hour, the learning specialist (LS) will discuss with you about your needs and challenges. The LS will ask you some questions regarding your previous experience in the classroom and during evaluations. With the help of the medical documentation and your conversation, you will build an accommodation plan together.

Once setup, you will find the details of your accommodation plan in your Ventus profile. Once you have enrolled in a course, you need to select which accommodations you will need for each course. Your professors are automatically requested to notify our Exam Centre about the exams in classes. When professors submit their notice of examination (NOE), you immediately receive an email telling you to select your accommodations and confirm your accommodation request for each separate exam.

<h5>
  Can I follow-up with my Learning Specialist?
</h5>
Of course! Your learning specialist can help you throughout your academic journey. They can offer several different strategies for various topics such as Study Strategies, Time Management Skills, Stress Management, Note taking Skills…and more! Ask your LS about working on strategies together. They might also refer you to other services that specialize in certain areas, such as the Academic Writing Help Centre or the Assistive Technology Lab<br>
<strong>Follow up metings with Learning Specialists can involve:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Discussing Learning Strategies such as time management skills, organization or managing stress during exams.​</li>
  <li>Reviewing accommodations if new documentation is provided by the student.​</li>
  <li>Developing communication strategies and self-advocacy skills for interacting with professors and faculty.​</li>
