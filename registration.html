      <h4>
        What is Ventus?
      </h4>
      <p>
        You may have heard that our University uses a tool called Ventus. What
        is it?<br/>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Ventus is the Accommodation Management application designed to
          decrease the work required of students with disabilities, to
          streamline, simplify and speed up communication regarding student
          accommodations.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is used to facilitate information sharing between all of the
          partners in the accommodation process.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ventus is an online portal used by students, learning specialists,
          professors and faculty to facilitate the adapted examination and
          accommodation process.
        </li>
      </ul>
      The Ventus student portal lets you create your own account, which
      guarantees that all of your personal information is kept confidential.
      Ventus will allow you to:
      <ul>
        <li>submit medical documentation</li>
        <li>keep track of all your present and past accommodations</li>
        <li>see your appointments dates and times</li>
        <li>see your exams throughout the semester</li>
        <li>confirm exam participation & select exam accommodations</li>
        <li>
          get reminders of when your medical documents or accommodations expire
        </li>
        <li>keep track of the letters issued by your learning specialist.</li>
        <li>
          access to the transcriptions request form if you need to have
          textbooks and readings transcribed into an alternate format
        </li>
        <li>
          access your profile on the go using either a smartphone or tablet

        <br />
        Your professor and faculty members also have a Ventus Portal but with
        different access to information. This is where they find out which
        students registered in their courses also registered for Academic
        Accommodations. Therefore, faculty will have access to your name and
        accommodations only.

      <h4>
        What is the intake form?
      </h4>

      <p>
        The intake form is a short questionnaire about previous accommodations,
        your habits, abilities, and strengths, and the tools you already used to
        be successful in school. After creating an account, you will be asked to
        fill out the intake form just one time. It lets the Learning Specialist
        know a little more about your learning skills, in-class and out-of-class
        before you meet to work together on identifying what your needs and
        accommodations.<br />
        <br />
        Your answers will give your learning specialist insight about your
        challenges and supports for your academic journey.

      <h4>
        How do I book an appointment?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Once you follow all the previous steps, you can book an initial meeting with
        a Learning Specialist by contacting us:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sending an email to adapt@uottawa.ca</li>
        <li>By telephone at 613-878-0146</li>
        <li>In person in the Desmarais Building, room 3172</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>
        What should I expect during my initial appointment?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Your initial appointment will last approximately 1hr. During that hour, the
        learning specialist (LS) will discuss with you about the disability-related academic challenges, needs, and strengths. The LS will ask you some questions regarding your previous
        experience in the classroom and during evaluations. With the help of the
        medical documentation and your conversation, you will build an
        accommodation plan together.<br />
        <br />
        Once set up, you will find the details of your accommodation plan in your
        Ventus profile. Once you have enrolled in a course, you need to select
        which accommodations you will need for each course. Your professors need to notify our Exam Centre about the exams in
        classes. When professors submit their notice of examination (NOE), you will
        immediately receive an email requesting that you to select your accommodations
        and confirm your participation to write this exam.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h4>
        Can I follow-up with my Learning Specialist?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Of course! Your learning specialist can help you throughout your
        academic journey. They can offer several different strategies for
        various topics such as Exam Review, Time Management Skills, Stress
        Management, Note taking Skills… and more! Ask your LS about working on
        strategies together. They might also refer you to other services that
        specialize in certain areas, such as the Academic Writing Help Centre or
        the Assistive Technology Lab<br />
