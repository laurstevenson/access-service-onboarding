            Our office supports students by establishing classroom and exam
            accommodations, being mindful that accommodations do not guarantee
            academic achievement; students with accommodations will experience
            similar challenges and successes as their peers do in their
            programs. Additionally, we can develop a learning strategy plan and help you navigate the different resources on campus.<br />
