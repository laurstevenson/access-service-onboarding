          <strong>The Education Act (1990)</strong><br />
          <p>
            The Education Act, 1990 in Ontario allows for the accommodation and support of identified students without a formal disability diagnosis. Some identified students are granted an individual education plan (IEP). It should be noted that identification as an exceptional student or being granted an IEP in high school is not the same as a diagnosis of a permanent disability.

At the University of Ottawa, only students with verified disabilities are entitled to academic accommodations with proper documentation. A prior history of accommodation in high school on its own does not warrant the provision of similar accommodations at the University of Ottawa.

          <strong>False!</strong><br />
          <p>
            The University of Ottawa provides reasonable and appropriate accommodations to students with a known disability as required under the Ontario Human Rights Code, not the Education Act. Only students with a known disability are entitled to accommodations at the post-secondary level.
