            There are many different reasons why you may need to contact your healthcare provider and defer an exam/assignment, some examples include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>You realize you are having symptoms of a cold or flu and maybe even a
          fever</li>
            <li>Sudden symptoms or signs that you are not thinking clearly and feel a
          panic or anxiety attack.</li>
            <li>The assignment you worked on is due tomorrow but you slipped and hit
          your head so hard that you might have a concussion.</li>
            <li> The symptoms of your medical condition have changed, worsened or
          become very painful such as a migraine or chronic illness.</li>
          </ul>
         <p>
           Whatever your situation may be, refer to Academic Regulation 9.5 to follow the university's guideline's on deferring an exam or requesting an extension on an assignment.
